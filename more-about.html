        <p>
          Hello! I’m Afroza Sumaya—a creative mind with a strong interest in both technology and art.
          I’m currently exploring the dynamic world of web development while nurturing my passion for visual storytelling through character design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love combining creativity with logic. Coding helps me structure ideas and solve problems, while character design lets me explore personality and emotion visually.
          I'm always eager to learn new tools and techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
           In web development, I enjoy crafting responsive, user-friendly websites that combine functionality with aesthetic appeal.
            Whether it's front-end design or back-end logic, I love building digital experiences that are both useful and engaging.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, character design allows me to express my imagination through visual storytelling.
            Creating original characters with distinct personalities and visual styles is something that inspires me constantly. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from coding and drawing, I enjoy reading, listening to music, and diving into animated films or games for inspiration.
          My goal is to build meaningful digital products and bring characters to life in ways that connect with people.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is just the beginning of my journey — and I’m excited to see where it leads.
